## Description:

This application allows users to create their own professional README file for projects.

## Installation:

npm i inquirer

## Usage:

To initiate the application, the user enters 'node index.js' into their terminal. The user will then be prompted with a series of questions pertaining to the information included in a professional README file. The user simply types their responses and presses 'enter' once each question is answered. When asked to choose a license, the user is able to select from a list of options. Once all the questions have been answered, the user will be informed that a new README file has been generated. The user can then view their completed README.md in the proper format. The README will include the project title, a badge for the license, a functional table of contents, project description, installation requirements, usage, license information and link, credits, tests, and contact information, with working links.
